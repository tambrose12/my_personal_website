    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <div id="intro">
        <h2>My name is Taylor Ambrose</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer looking to make a big life change. After working in the mortgage industry
            for
            over 6 years, I decided it is time to take a leap and persue an industry that has piqued my interest since
            my
            college years back in 2016. Making a big change like this is a bit outside my confort zone, but I am eager
            to
            learn all that I can and have a great support system in place. A loving husband that always has my back and
            wants the best for me, friends in the industry that are willing to help when I feel clueless, and a
            supportive
            family cheering me on for this next chapter in my life.</p>

        <h3>A Little About Me...</h3>
        <p>I was born in a tiny town in western New York state, about an hour or two south of Buffalo. I attended
            Jamestown
            Community College where I received my Associates Degree in Individual Studies. The day I graduated from
            college,
            May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2016, was also the day I married my best friend from high school. A week after my
            graduation and marriage, we had packed up everything we owned and our dog, Thor, and moved to South Carolina
            where some of my family was already living. I had considered trying to go to college for Computer Science,
            but
            we were in the process of buying our first home, money was in low supply, and I needed a job at the time.
        </p>
        <p>While in the process of buying our first home, the Mortgage Loan Officer we were working with seemed to think
            I
            was picking up on the mortgage process fairly quickly and easily. He knew I needed a job, and they needed
            employees, so he offered me a position that I happily accepted. There was a lot to learn and a lot of
            engaging
            aspects of the industry, and I was able to work my way up in terms of pay and position fairly quickly.
            Anyone
            who has ever worked in the mortgage industry can tell you it has a way of drawing people in and they rarely
            ever
            escape. After three years in the industry, I was promoted to a Mortgage Underwriter position which I held
            for
            the next three years. It felt like a blink of an eye and six years had passed in an industry I had never
            meant
            to fall into (though I do not necessarily regret falling into it - I met a lot of great people and was able
            to
            build a stable life with that career).</p>
        <p>All of that said, the I felt for years like I was missing some level of fulfillment in my career. I would
            love to
            be able to put my skills to use in a field that can involve a little more creativity... a satisfaction of
            building things... watching something come together.</p>

        <h4>I took a wild leap...</h4>
        <p>After working hard for years to save up money and reach a place where I could circle back and persue a career
            in
            computer science, or software engineering, I quit my comfortable job as an Underwriter in January 2023 to
            focus
            on this new path. I had already been working on some self-paced learning, but it was time to take the full
            leap
            and dive into this new field. Change can be scary, but so can a life of regret of having never tried
            something.
